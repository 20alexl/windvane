"""Milestones: the model's own "this step is done" as the checkpoint trigger.

A checkpoint is a deliberate call. windvane never writes one from a commit or
a timer on the model's behalf. What it does is read the moment the model
itself judges a unit of work closed -- "Phase 1 built", "step 3 done, next
is the run report", "all 60 checks pass" -- and, if no deliberate checkpoint
landed with that claim, ask for one at the next opportunity.

Where the judgment shows up (verified against the hooks reference):

  * The Stop hook receives ``last_assistant_message`` verbatim. That is the
    sentence where a step gets declared done. Read here.
  * ``ExitPlanMode``: a plan just got approved. Its steps ARE the milestone
    list, so bank the plan as a checkpoint with those steps pending.
  * ``TaskUpdate`` with ``status: completed``: the same judgment stated
    structurally. Claude Code leaves the task tools out on the newest models
    unless the user opts in, so this is a bonus path, not the design.

The classifier is two-tier like decision capture: a regex tier that wants a
completion word NEAR a unit noun (phase / step / part / ...), and, for weak
matches only, a semantic tier through the daemon. Questions, negations
and future tense are rejected in the regex tier so "when phase 1 is done"
and "is step 3 finished?" never fire.

The nudge lands one turn late in an interactive session -- a Stop hook
cannot add context to the turn that just ended -- and at the next tool call
in a loop. The rule in the skill ("checkpoint before you declare a step
done") is the ideal path; this is the miss-catcher.
