Background Miner — subprocess spawner for session log processing.

Heavy mining can't happen in hooks (1-2s timeout). This module spawns
a detached background process that runs after the hook returns.

Follows the same pattern as the daemon (windvane.daemon): subprocess.Popen
with CREATE_NO_WINDOW on Windows, start_new_session on Unix.
