"""
Where the repo and the run stand, for a checkpoint to record and a restore
to compare against.

A restored checkpoint carries the last session's framing. Before acting on
it the model should know how far the repo moved since: commits landed,
files changed, and whether the files the checkpoint names are among them.
That is one git call at save time (the commit) and two at restore time
(bounded, best effort, silent when there is no repo).

The active /goal is the other thing a checkpoint should carry: a resumed
session then reads the condition it is working toward without re-mining
the transcript.
