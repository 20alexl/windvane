    Descendants are in scope because a workspace root is a real place to ask
    from. Without them, a restore at ``<workspace>`` could only read the root
    ring while the session's actual final checkpoint sat in
    ``<workspace>/app/sub`` — and, because the root ring is rarely empty,

    restoring stale state is the exact failure a checkpoint system exists to
    prevent, so a query now sees everything at or beneath it. (The SessionStart
    banner already resolved the subtree this way; the restore/list path did
    not.)

    Ordering does not decide selection — read_history sorts merged entries by
    recency and read_latest prefers the newest *manual* — so a nearer ring
    never wins on position alone, only on being newer.

    Descendants are still a strict subset of the tree you asked about: a
