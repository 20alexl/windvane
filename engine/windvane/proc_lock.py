"""A process-lifetime lock: an OS file lock the kernel releases when the
holder exits, however it exits.

The daemon and the background miner used pid files as their "one instance"
guard. A pid file is check-then-write (four miners started together all
acquired it, measured 2026-09-25) and it says nothing about whether the
holder can be reached, so a failed 0.5 s connect was read as a dead daemon:
the files were deleted, a second daemon spawned, and the first idled for
30 minutes at ~3 GB. Held lock = a live holder; nothing else is consulted.

stdlib only (msvcrt / fcntl): the hook client runs under ``python -S``.
